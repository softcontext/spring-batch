As we are using MySQL as our database, we need to download quartz distributable(http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/downloads/) 
and use the table structures that they have defined for MySQL. 
Once you have downloaded and executed the sql in your environment, 
the table will look like as below.

QRTZ_FIRED_TRIGGERS;
QRTZ_PAUSED_TRIGGER_GRPS;
QRTZ_SCHEDULER_STATE;
QRTZ_LOCKS;
QRTZ_SIMPLE_TRIGGERS;
QRTZ_SIMPROP_TRIGGERS;
QRTZ_CRON_TRIGGERS;
QRTZ_BLOB_TRIGGERS;
QRTZ_TRIGGERS;
QRTZ_JOB_DETAILS;
QRTZ_CALENDARS;
